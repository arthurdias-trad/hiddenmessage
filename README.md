# hiddenmessage
Python code to create a place to leave and receive passcoded messages. The user needs a passcode to start the program flow. Once started the user can choose to leave or receive a message. 

Users who leave a message will be given a code they and send, this code can be used to receive the message one time, and then the message will change. 

Users wishing to receive a message can enter the code sent to them to view their message, once their message has been viewed it will change, or maybe delete, or maybe just say its been viewed x number of times. We shall see.
